        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <h4>ETQ</h4>
        <img
          src="../lesson2/images/etq-phone-view.jpg"

          class="etq-pic"
        />
        <p>
          The ETQ website sells shoes and their website is extremely clean and
          uses white space to its advantage.
          <br />
          On the home page as you see captured in the image above you can see a
          snippet of the clan design they have used.
          <br />
          One thing that really makes a difference in this site is that they
          went the extra mile to make not only the site and design clean but
          also all the images on the site are very clean looking, match each
          other, and use white space.

        <h3>PARC: Proximity</h3>
        <h4>JULUANA</h4>
        <img
          src="../lesson2/images/juluana-phone-view.jpg"
          alt="Screenshot of the Juluana website"
          class="juluana-pic"
        />
        <p>
          Good use of proximity is really important in a website and the Juluana
          site has good use of proximity.
          <br />
          You can't tell as much from this one screenshot but as you scroll
          through this bike site everything is spaced out perfectly and all the
          elements and titles that go with each other are spaced in such a way
          that your mind automatically know they go together.

        <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
        <h4>IMPOSIBLE BUREAU</h4>
        <img
          src="../lesson2/images/imposible-phone-view.jpg"
          alt="Screenshot of the Imposible Bureau website"
          class="imposible-pic"
        />
        <p>
          The Imposible Bureau site is a great example of Fit's Law because it's
          full of really interactive designs and features.
          <br />
          The loading screen alone has a really cool effect where the colors
          change when the mouse moves, and when you go to the other pages in the
          site there are more effects that draw the viewer in and keep them
          interested.
